Hansards-Matching-Quiz
======================

This is the full code for a project created during Rewired State Parliament 2013, a website which allows users to guess the correct title of a hansard (a transcript of a discussion in Parliament) based on a random quote from it. I do not guarantee the code is the most efficient it could be or that it consistently follows best practice (it *was* put together in less than 24 hours).

Improvements to be made (contributions very welcome):
- Random incorrect titles sometimes appear as "undefined".
